Note: One needs to go to the trilinos-TPLs folder 
which should be created under trilinos to edit or 
run netcdf-c-4.3.1.1-configure to install netcdf
before one come back to the trilinos-dev folder to
install trilinos. --Ming Gong 

After installation of the required third party packages, 
One needs to run the file called cmake-ming_mu-tc-stk-mpi.sh
at the current folder to install Trilinos and its enabled 
packages. One can make corresponding changes in the file 
cmake-ming_mu-tc-stk-mpi.sh to enable certain trilinos' packages
or successfully install trilinos.--Ming Gong
